# CMPEN 472 Homework 11 - ADC Integration Project

## Project Overview
This project involves modifying an existing waveform generator program to add Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) functionality. The new functionality will be accessed through a new 'adc' command while preserving all existing command functionality.

## Core Requirements

### Existing Functionality to Preserve
The following commands must remain fully functional:
- 't' - Time-related functionality
- 'gw' - Wave generation
- 'gw2' - Secondary wave generation
- 'gt' - Triangle wave generation
- 'gq' - Square wave generation
- 'gq2' - Secondary square wave generation
- 's' - Seconds display
- 'm' - Minutes display
- 'q' - Quit command

### New ADC Command Implementation
- Command: 'adc'
- Purpose: Convert analog signals to digital data
- Display: Output converted values to terminal in ASCII format
- Integration: Must work alongside existing waveform generation features

## Technical Constraints
- Platform: MC9S12C128 microcontroller
- Environment: CodeWarrior IDE
- Must maintain compatibility with existing code structure
- Must follow proper ADC initialization and configuration

## Success Criteria
1. Successful ADC command implementation
2. Proper analog to digital conversion
3. Accurate terminal output display
4. Integration without breaking existing functionality
5. Clean code organization and documentation

## Project Files
- main.asm: Main program file containing existing functionality
- hw11samp4gSim.asm: Reference implementation for ADC functionality
- Additional support documentation and files

## Notes
- Sample code provided is for reference only
- Direct 1:1 code usage may not be appropriate
- Must adapt ADC implementation to match existing program structure
