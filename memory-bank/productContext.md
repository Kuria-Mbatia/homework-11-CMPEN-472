# Product Context

## Purpose and Goals
This project serves educational purposes for learning analog signal acquisition programming on the MC9S12C128 microcontroller. The core goals include:

1. Implementing ADC functionality to capture and display analog signals
2. Maintaining a digital clock running in the background
3. Preserving existing waveform generation capabilities
4. Learning to use timer interrupts for precise timing control

## User Experience

### Overall Flow
1. User boots the system, which initializes all components
2. System displays digital clock on 7-segment display
3. Terminal shows prompt "HW11> " for command input
4. User can enter commands to control various functions
5. System responds to commands while maintaining clock functionality

### ADC Command Experience
When using the 'adc' command:
1. User connects analog signal to ADC channel 7
2. User enters 'adc' command at terminal prompt
3. System acknowledges with "analog signal acquisition ...."
4. System captures 2048 samples at precise 8kHz rate
5. Each sample is displayed as decimal value on terminal
6. After all samples, system displays "Finished"
7. System returns to command prompt
8. Clock continues running throughout process

### Time and Display Commands
The system maintains existing functionality:
- 't HH:MM:SS' - Set time
- 'h' - Display hours on 7-segment display
- 'm' - Display minutes on 7-segment display
- 's' - Display seconds on 7-segment display

### Waveform Generation Commands
Existing waveform generation commands remain functional:
- 'gw' - Generate sawtooth wave
- 'gw2' - Generate 100Hz sawtooth wave
- 'gt' - Generate triangle wave
- 'gq' - Generate square wave
- 'gq2' - Generate 100Hz square wave

### Error Handling
Users receive clear error messages:
- Invalid command format: "Invalid input format"
- Invalid time format: "Error> Invalid time format. Correct example => 00:00:00 to 23:59:59"

## Integration Context
The ADC functionality is one component of a larger embedded system featuring:
1. Time management (digital clock)
2. Waveform generation (various wave types)
3. Signal acquisition (ADC)
4. User interface (terminal commands and display)

## User Benefits
1. Real-time visualization of analog signals
2. Ability to capture precisely timed analog data for analysis
3. Continuous time tracking during signal operations
4. Multiple waveform generation capabilities
5. Interactive command-based control

## Technical Requirements from User Perspective
1. ADC samples must be taken at exactly 8kHz
2. All 2048 samples must be displayed in decimal format
3. Digital clock must remain functional during ADC operation
4. All commands must continue working properly
5. Terminal must display appropriate feedback messages

## Limitations
1. Single ADC channel available (channel 7)
2. Fixed sample rate (8kHz)
3. Fixed sample count (2048)
4. Command inputs restricted to terminal interface
5. Display limited to 7-segment and terminal output
