# Progress

## Completed Items
- Project requirements analyzed and documented
- Sample code (hw11samp4gSim.asm) studied
- Implementation plan created with detailed steps
- System architecture and patterns documented
- Hardware specifications and register details identified

## In Progress
- ADC register and variable definitions
- Timer OC5 configuration for 8kHz sampling
- ADC command parser integration
- Binary to decimal conversion routine
- Terminal output formatting

## Pending Items
- ADC initialization implementation
- Timer OC5 interrupt service routine
- ADC command handler
- Integration with existing clock functionality
- Testing and validation of ADC functionality

## Known Issues
- None identified yet

## Next Actions
1. Add ADC register definitions to main.asm
2. Implement ADC initialization routine
3. Configure Timer OC5 for 125Î¼s interrupts
4. Add 'adc' command recognition to command parser
5. Develop Timer OC5 ISR for ADC sampling

## Project Status
- Timeline: On track
- Implementation: Not started
- Testing: Not started

## Testing Strategy
1. ADC Initialization
   - Verify register configuration
   - Confirm ADC module enables correctly

2. Timer Configuration
   - Verify 8kHz interrupt timing
   - Confirm OC5 ISR triggers at correct rate

3. Command Parsing
   - Test 'adc' command recognition
   - Verify error handling for invalid formats

4. ADC Sampling
   - Verify 2048 samples are collected
   - Confirm sampling rate is precisely 8kHz
   - Validate decimal output format

5. Integration Testing
   - Verify clock continues during ADC operation
   - Test all commands still function
   - Check for timing conflicts
