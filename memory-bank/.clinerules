# Project Intelligence and Rules

## MC9S12C128 ADC Integration Rules

### Register Naming and Access
- ADC registers should be referenced with symbolic names (ATDCTL2, etc.)
- Use full register names in comments for clarity
- Configure registers using binary notation (%10101010) for bit-level clarity
- Follow the datasheet bit definitions precisely

### Timing Considerations
- Timer OC5 must be set for exactly 125μs intervals (8kHz)
- ADC conversion must be started immediately after reading previous result
- Terminal output must be completed within timing window
- Interrupt latency must be considered in timing calculations

### Command Parse Pattern
- Follow existing command parse pattern in main.asm
- Compare first character, then subsequent characters
- Validate full command before executing
- Return error message for invalid formats

### Output Formatting Standards
- ADC values must be displayed in decimal format (0-255)
- Each value should be followed by a space or newline
- Output routine must be optimized for speed
- Consider buffer strategy for high-speed output

### Variable Naming
- Use ADC_prefix for ADC-related variables
- Boolean flags should be clear in their meaning (ADC_ACTIVE, not FLAG1)
- Counter variables should indicate purpose (ADC_COUNTER, not CNT)
- Constants should be descriptive (ADC_SAMPLE_COUNT, not NUM)

### Interrupt Handling
- Save all affected registers at start of ISR
- Restore all registers before returning
- Keep ISRs as short as possible
- Use flags for communication between ISRs and main code

### Binary-to-Decimal Conversion
- Use division method for 8-bit to decimal conversion
- Extract digits from most to least significant
- Convert binary digits to ASCII by adding $30
- Optimize for speed since conversion happens at 8kHz

### Code Organization
- Group ADC initialization with other initialization code
- Keep ADC-related subroutines together
- Add clear section headers in comments
- Document critical timing requirements in comments

### Critical Paths
- Timer OC5 ISR → Read ADC → Output → Start ADC → Update counter
- Command parser → ADC command handler → Enable Timer OC5
- ADC completion → Disable Timer OC5 → Print "Finished"

### Error Prevention
- Always check if ADC is already active before starting
- Implement timeout detection for ADC operations
- Verify correct ADC channel (7) is selected
- Verify Timer OC5 is correctly configured before enabling

### Testing Approach
- Verify timing with simulator/debugger tools
- Check signal integrity with simulated input
- Confirm exact count of 2048 samples
- Verify clock continues running during ADC operation
